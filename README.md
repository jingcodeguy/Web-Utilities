#### 🔧 SiteGround Dynamic Cache Clear Tool

A utility to flush SiteGround's dynamic cache using their internal Unix socket API — especially useful when SiteGround's aggressive cache settings interfere with PHP/database changes.

> Normally, cache purging requires manual operation in SiteGround's backend. This tool offers a programmable workaround for development/testing environments.
